/**
 * Pages - Page-level components
 *
 * Each page represents a full screen/route in the application.
 * Pages should be thin wrappers that compose components and handle page-level logic.
 *
 * Structure:
 * /pages
 *   /HomePage
 *     index.jsx
 *     HomePage.jsx
 *   /TemasPage
 *     index.jsx
 *   ...
 */

// Pages will be exported here as they are migrated
// Example: export { default as HomePage } from './HomePage';
